BUS4 118D Big Data Project: The Relentless Wranglers

Purpose
Using Python, SQL, and Tableau, the team will analyze Yelp's dataset to answer a hypothetical question, thereby providing key business insights for Yelp Inc.

Background & Business Need
Yelp Inc. provides a platform that enables end-users to post online reviews about local businesses, which means anyone can post a review regardless of background (e.g., age, occupation). Therefore, in its early days, Yelp Inc. faced criticisms on whether users would listen to young adults (i.e., college students) who wrote reviews on their platform. Given this context, the team was tasked to examine the following question:

Do restaurants near a college campus (undergrad or community college) receive higher or lower ratings than other restaurants further away from college campuses? In other words, do college students skew restaurant ratings?

The following sub-questions will be investigated as well:

Is this pattern consistent or different across the eight metro areas?
Is this pattern consistent or different for chain restaurants (e.g., McDonald's, Subway)?
How many businesses do not say what type of business they are?
Outcome
Using the CoNVO (context, need, vision, outcome) framework, the team came up with a vision first for what a possible answer might look like via brainstorming and hand-drawn charts. Once satisfied, we began working backwards to reach that vision using Python and SQL. As a result, this notebook outlines and describes the data wrangling steps (e.g., structuring, transforming, enriching) required and displays our findings in a graphical format using Tableau.
